				<em>Configuration</em>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Configuration</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes it is useful to provide some defaults or settings throuh the application configuration.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are multiple mechanisms to do so, the easiest is to annotate class field with <code>@Value</code> annotation.
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs java">
						@Service
						public class HelloService {

							@Value("${hello.default-name}")
							private String defaultName;

							@Value("${hello.default-locale}")
							private String defaultLocale;

							private final HelloRepository helloRepository;

							public HelloService(HelloRepository helloRepository) {
								this.helloRepository = helloRepository;
							}

							public String sayHello(String name, String locale) {
								String hello = helloRepository.selectHelloInLanguage(locale != null ? locale : defaultLocale);
								return String.format("%s %s!", hello, name != null ? name : defaultName);
							}

						}
					</code>
				</pre>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs properties">
						hello:
						  default-name: Anonymous
						  default-locale: en
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Configuration</h3>
				<p>
					Another option is to create configuration class
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs java">
						@Configuration
						@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "hello")
						public class HelloConfigurationProperties {

							private String defaultName;
							private String defaultLocale;

							public String getDefaultName() {
								return defaultName;
							}

							public String getDefaultLocale() {
								return defaultLocale;
							}

							public void setDefaultName(String defaultName) {
								this.defaultName = defaultName;
							}

							public void setDefaultLocale(String defaultLocale) {
								this.defaultLocale = defaultLocale;
							}
						}
					</code>
				</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Configuration</h4>
				<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape data-line-numbers class="hljs java">
						@Service
						public class HelloService {

							private final HelloRepository helloRepository;
							private final HelloConfigurationProperties config;

							public HelloService(HelloRepository helloRepository, HelloConfigurationProperties config) {
								this.helloRepository = helloRepository;
								this.config = config;
							}

							public String sayHello(String name, String locale) {
								String hello = helloRepository.selectHelloInLanguage(locale != null ? locale : config.getDefaultLocale());
								return String.format("%s %s!", hello, name != null ? name : config.getDefaultName());
							}

						}

				<h2>Application Architecture</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Application Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					There are several application architecture approaches that are commonly used in the development
					of software applications, which are used to define the structure of the application and the way
					in which the different components of the application interact with each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way many ways to categorize them is by how loosely or tightly coupled the application components are, as ...
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Monolithic Architecture</li>
					<li>Microservice Architecture</li>
					<li>Serverless Architecture</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Or how the application components interact with each other, as ...
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Synchronous (Request/Response)</li>
					<li>Asynchronous (Event-Driven)</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Monolithic Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					With monolithic architecture, the application is built and deployed as a single unit.
					All the application components are part of the same codebase.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					<strong>Advantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This architecture may be better for small applications.</li>
					<li>On small applications, monolithic architecture, is easier to develop test and deploy.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Disadvantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When change is made in one component, the entire application needs to be rebuilt and redeployed.</li>
					<li>The application can only by scaled as a single unit.</li>
					<li>Larger applications can become difficult to manage and maintain.</li>
					<li>Monolithic architecture is not suitable for large applications, as it can become difficult to develop and maintain.</li>
					<li>Unfortunately, in real the world, it is often large applications that are monolithic.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Microservice Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					With microservice architecture, the application is broken down into a set of smaller,
					independent services that are developed and deployed separately.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					<strong>Advantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Individual services can be run and deployed independently.</li>
					<li>Higher resiliency and fault tolerance - if one service fails, the rest of the system should still be available.</li>
					<li>Better scalability - each service can be scaled independently</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Disadvantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Infrastructure may be more challenging to maintain.</li>
					<li>Developers must account for the additional complexity of managing the communication between services.</li>
					<li>Developers must be careful to avoid creating a distributed monolith by having highly dependent services.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Serverless Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					With serverless architecture, the application is built and deployed as a set of functions that
					are executed in response to events.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Advantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>High level of scalability</li>
					<li>High level of availability</li>
					<li>High level of fault tolerance</li>
					<li>Operational cost - depends on the actual usage.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Disadvantages</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Testng, debugging and monitoring may be challenging</li>
					<li>Often comes with vendor lock-in in form of the cloud provider</li>
					<li>Execution limits (maximum execution time)</li>
					<li>Startup latency</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
				<em>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous communication</em>
				<!--				<p>-->
				<!--					Another way to look at architecture is by how the application components interact with each other.-->
				<!--				</p>-->
				<hr />
				<p>
					Traditional applications, like RESTful web services, are often built using a
					<strong>synchronous</strong> communication model.
					<br />
					=
					<br />
					<em>Client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.</em>
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					<strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>, is built on an <strong>asynchronous</strong> communication model.
					<br />
					=
					<br />
					<em>Sender sends a message and continues with other work without waiting for the recipient to process the message and reply.</em>
				</p>
				<hr />
				<blockquote>
					Both models can be used for communication between system component as well with the system components themselves.
				</blockquote>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					In event-driven architecture, components of the system are emitting events and reacting to events emitting by other components.
				</p>
				<p>
					Events are emitted and consumed through a message broker (message queues).
					(example of such are RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					This model is also often called <strong>Publisher-Subscriber</strong> or <strong>Publisher-Consumer</strong> model.
				</p>
				<p>
					This architecture provides high level of decoupling between components.
					Individual components only know what messages they produce and receive, but do not know anything about the system producing and consuming them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another advantage of this model is that there may be multiple Subscribers (consumers) for a single message.
				</p>

				<h2>Spring WebFlux</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Spring WebFlux</h3>
				<p>
					In this course, we worked with the Spring MVC model. But it is not the only model of building applications with Spring.
					The alternative to Spring MVC is <strong>Spring Webflux</strong>.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					<strong>Spring MVC</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Spring MVC uses a blocking I/O model, which means the thread that runs the application code will wait or block for each input/output operation.</li>
					<li>This framework is a good choice when developing a traditional web application or REST API.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Spring Webflux</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Spring Webflux is a framework based on reactive streams, and is fully non-blocking.</li>
					<li>It offers a choice of using either asynchronous or synchronous I/O.</li>
					<li>Because of its non-blocking nature, Webflux allows many more requests to be handled concurrently.</li>
					<li>In general, this framework is a good choice when you need to handle a large number of concurrent connections with fewer threads (like in a mobile API, real-time status updates, and remote event notifications).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Reactive Streams</h3>
				<p>
					Reactive Streams is a specification for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Reactive streams are build on 4 principles:
				</p>
				<ul style="font-size: 80%">
					<li>
						<strong>Asynchronous</strong><br />
						In a <strong>synchronous</strong> communication, the sender sends a message and waits for the recipient to process the message and reply.<br />
						In an <strong>asynchronous</strong> communication, the sender sends a message and continues with other work. The recipient will process the message and reply when it has completed its business.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Non-blocking</strong><br />
						In the non-blocking paradigm, a piece of code will never stop the progress of the execution because it needs input from another piece.
						The execution will continue, and when the input is available, it will complete the operation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Stream Processing</strong><br />
						Stream processing is a computational model that allows real-time processing of data feeds from many sources concurrently.
						<!--						It is beneficial when working with a high volume of data, each of which needs to be processed as it arrives—in other words, -->
						<!--						processing the data "online" as opposed to "batch" processing.-->
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Back pressure</strong><br />
						Back Pressure is a way for a consumer of data to communicate with its producer about its current availability,
						effectively slowing down the production rate to match the consumption rate.
						Without back pressure, a fast producer can overwhelm a slow consumer leading to resource exhaustion.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<!--				<p>-->
				<!--					Reactive streams are by design asynchronous and non-blocking.-->
				<!--					This means that the consumer can consume data as it is produced, without having to wait for the producer to finish producing the data.-->
				<!--				</p>-->
				<!--				<p>-->
				<!--					Back pressure is a way for a consumer to tell a producer to slow down.-->
				<!--					It is a way to handle a situation where the producer is producing data faster than the consumer can consume it.-->
				<!--				</p>-->

				<h2>Spring Cloud</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Spring Cloud</h3>
				<p>
					Spring Cloud is a set of tools and libraries that are used to build and deploy cloud-native applications.
					These tools are primarily used to develop applications using microservice or serverless architecture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tools and libraries that are part of Spring Cloud include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Integration with cloud providers such as AWS and Azure</li>
					<li>Distributed configuration</li>
					<li>Service registration and discovery</li>
					<li>Service-to-service communication and messaging</li>
					<li>Routing, load balancing and circuit breakers</li>
					<li>Short-lived microservices</li>
					<li>Cloud security</li>
					<li>Testing support</li>
